# substack-clone: : Your Own Community Hub
Developed by Oz Chicas on May 19, 2023

## Description 
    Welcome to my full-stack web application, built as a feature-rich clone of the popular Substack platform. I've built this project to empower creators like you, allowing you to connect with your audience and grow your community with the magic of written content.

    Powered by a combination of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and EJS, our application employs the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern. Embrace the simplicity of creating, reading, updating, and deleting articles - a feature that stands at the heart of this application.
